# warranty
Objective- the main aim of this project is to find whether the claim by the customers to the electronics company is fraud or genuine. 

Methods & Algorithms- Random forest (over sampling) algorithm is used to build the model.

Language- Python 

IDE- Jupyter Notebook

Brief Description- Warranty claim data set of Electronics Company was considered. Did Explonatory data analyis to understand the data. Replace the missing values with median imputation. The dataset was imbalanced; to overcome it over sampling of minority class was done using SMOTE. Decision tree and random forest algorithm gave the best accuracy of 97.32% among all the algorithms. 

Business Benefits- When an item is sold, then what is the probability that customer would file for warranty and to understand important factors associated with them. This is the problem facing by the organizations. To understand whether the claim is a genuine claim or a fraudulent claim based on different independent variables.
