Objective- the main aim of this project is to find whether the claim by the customers to the electronics company is fraud or genuine. 

Methods & Algorithms- Random forest (up sampling) algorithm is used to build the model.

Tools- Python 3

IDE- Spyder

Brief Description- Warranty claim data set of Electronics Company was considered. We analyse the data and check for the duplicate values and removed them. Replace the missing values with median imputation. The dataset was imbalanced; to overcome it up sampling and down sampling of majority and minority class was done. Finally model was built using Random Forest (up sampling) algorithm. The accuracy of the model was 96%. Model was deployed using Flask.

Business Benefits- the business benefit of the project is to check the fraud claims done by the customers.
